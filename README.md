 Interactive tool to teach Bio Inspired Algorithm

# SUMMARY OF REPORT
The aim of this project is to create easy, accessible and affective tools for teaching
basic biological algorithms. Biological algorithms have been around for a very long
time and have provided solutions to a lot of phenomena. However, their contribution
is little known to those not involved in the biological field. This could be attributed
to the complexity of the algorithms or the lack of understanding the basic biological
concepts. Therefor this project aims on creating a tools for such people to understand
biological algorithms and their functioning in a very simple way without having to
be aware of the concepts. These tools are coded in a way to deconstruct and show
how the basic working of different algorithms. Most existing teaching tools are
primitive and expensive and require a basic knowledge of the fundamentals. So, this
tool fixes all these issues by making learning accessible, cheap and easily
understandable. These application will be developed using java and python. This
application is the first of its kind because of which the approach being followed would
be very preliminary and simple. However, it has a lot of scope and be developed
extensively to make it more robust and effective. This application aims on explaining
both the physical and theoretical aspects of the biological algorithms. As of know the
algorithms have been categorized into categories based on their functionality
including genetic and optimization algorithms
